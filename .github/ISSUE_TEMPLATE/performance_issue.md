## ‚ö° Performance Issue Description

**Describe the performance problem**
A clear and concise description of the performance issue you're experiencing.

**Expected performance**
What performance level did you expect?

**Actual performance**
What performance are you actually seeing?

## üìä Performance Metrics

**Timing measurements:**
```
# Paste timing information here
Command: integrityz check
Time taken: X minutes Y seconds
Files scanned: N files
Average files/second: X
```

**Resource usage:**
- CPU usage: [percentage or detailed breakdown]
- Memory usage: [peak memory, average memory]
- Disk I/O: [read/write patterns if known]
- Network usage: [if applicable]

**System specifications:**
- CPU: [processor model and cores]
- RAM: [total amount]
- Storage: [SSD/HDD, filesystem type]
- OS: [operating system and version]

## üîÑ Reproducible Test Case

**Dataset characteristics:**
- Total files: [number]
- Total size: [GB/TB]
- Directory depth: [maximum depth]
- File types: [mix of file types]
- Average file size: [if known]

**Command used:**
```bash
# Exact command that shows performance issue
integrityz [command] [options]
```

**Performance comparison:**
```
# Before (if applicable):
Operation X: Y seconds

# After some change:
Operation X: Z seconds

# Or comparison with other tools:
Tool A: X seconds
IntegrityZ: Y seconds
```

## üéØ Performance Goals

**What would be acceptable performance?**
- [ ] 2x faster than current
- [ ] Comparable to [other tool]
- [ ] Specific target: [X files/second, Y GB/minute, etc.]

**Performance priorities:**
- [ ] Faster scanning
- [ ] Lower memory usage

**Ideas for improvement:**
- [ ] Parallel processing
- [ ] Better caching
- [ ] Algorithm optimization
- [ ] Reduced memory allocations
- [ ] Streaming processing
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Are you willing to work on a fix?**
- [ ] Yes, I can contribute code
- [ ] Yes, but need guidance
- [ ] No, but can test solutions
- [ ] No, just reporting

## üìà Impact Assessment

**How critical is this performance issue?**
